## Contents of my files

1. Solution_1.py contains my solution to problem 1 in the Problem Set which asks the user to input a positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number. 

2. Solution_2.py contains my solution to problem 2 in the Problem Set which outputs whether or not today is a day beginning with the letter T. 

3. Solution_3.py contains my solution to problem 3 in the Problem Set which prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not divisible by 12. 



## References 
In developing my answer to Solution_3.py I read about using "and" to combine logical statements on this website which allowed me to use one line of code to ask for two conditions to be met: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
