# Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Problem set 2019 for the module Programming and Scripting at GMIT.
See here for the instructions - https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf.
The problem set consists of ten problems assigned to me as part of my learning in the Programming and Scripting module. I worked to solve all ten problems through a combination of watching the lectures on a weekly basis, extra reading and research online and implementing these learnings order to develop the solutions to each problem. 
In developing this Readme file I researched how to format the file and what headings should be included at the following links: https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/ and https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2

## Contents of my files
**In this section there is a breakdown on the contents of the files in my repository and some background to the contents of each file and the thought process that went into the writing of each file**

**1. Solution_1.py**

 This file contains my solution to problem 1 in the Problem Set which asks the user to input a positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number. In this solution I added a feature to return a message to the user asking them to only enter a positive integer if the number entered by them is less than zero. This feature is an if statement that prints this message to the screen if the user has entered an input less than zero.  In a similar way I have used an if statement to ensure the program is only run where the input is greater than one. I asked for one to be added to the users input and then established a range between 1 and the new value of the variable. The reason I increased the value the user entered by one is because this is necessary to have an accurate range. The sum function is then used to sum all the numbers in the range and print them to the screen.

2. Solution_2.py contains my solution to problem 2 in the Problem Set which outputs whether or not today is a day beginning with the letter T. The datetime module is used in this solution and there is an if statement used to check whether the current day is Tuesday or Thursday. I used the "or" keyword to check both conditions in the same line. An else statement is used to print an output for the other days of the week that are not given an output as a result of the if statement.

3. Solution_3.py contains my solution to problem 3 in the Problem Set which prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not divisible by 12. In this solution I established a range of numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 and and used an if statement to check the conditions outlined in the program. I used the "and" keyword to check both conditions in one line of code.

4. Solution_4.py contains my solution to problem 4 on the problem set. The program asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation: the current value is taken at each step and if it is even it is divided by 2 and if it is odd it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to the value. The program stops when the current value of the number is 1. This is known as Collatz Conjecture and no matter what number is inputted at the beginning of this calculation the result always arrives to 1. I used a while loop and set it to loop as long as the variable which in this case is the integer inputted by the user is greater than 1. Within this loop I used an if statement to identify even numbers with the modulo operator and I used an else statement to pick up all other integers (odd numbers). Within the if and else statements I assigned new values to the variable. When the program executes the loop runs as long as the number inputted by the user is greater than 1 and the results are printed to the screen. I also asked for the original value entered by the user to be printed to the screen first before the execution of the while loop. 

5. Solution_5.py contains my solution to solution 5 on the problem set. This program asks the user to input any positive integer and it tells the user if it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 divisible only by itself and 1. If a number is divisible by any other number it is not a prime number. In this solution a range is established between 2 and one less than the number inputted by the user. A for loop with an if statement embedded will run for each number in the range to detect if any number in the range is divisible by the number inputted in which case the number is proven not to be a prime. If no divisor is detected in the if statement the break keyword has been used to break out of the loop and an else statement runs to tell the user the number is a prime. I have also added a feature whereby if the user enters a number less than or equal to 1 they are prompted to enter only a number greater than 1.  

6. Solution_6.py contains my solution to problem 6 on the problem set. The program takes a user input string and outputs every second word. I used the .split and .join functions that we covered in week 7 lectures in writing this program. The .split function is used to split the string inputted by the user and take only every second word [::2] forming a list of these words. The .join function is used to join this list back together in string format and this is then printed to the screen. 

7. Solution_7.py contains my solution to problem 7 on the problem set. This is a program that takes a positive floating point number inputted by the user and outputs an approximation of the square root of that number. In this solution I used the math module to calculate the square root of the number inputted by the user and the round function to round the output to one decimal place.

The code we looked at is shown here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops I have also added a feature whereby if the user enters a number less than or equal to 1 they are prompted to enter only a number greater than 1.

7. Solution_7.py - In developing this program I used the math module to calculate the square root of a number inputted by the user. I read about the math.sqrt module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html I needed the output to be an approximation of the square root and so I used the round function to round the result of the math.sqrt calculation to one decimal place, I read about the round function here: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/round
