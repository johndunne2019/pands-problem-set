Solution_2.py -  I read about the datetime function here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9847213/how-do-i-get-the-day-of-week-given-a-date-in-python I researched how to use an "or" statement here which allowed me to check for both Tuesday and Thursday in one line: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
Solution_3.py - In developing my answer to Solution_3.py I read about using "and" to combine logical statements on this website which allowed me to use one line of code to ask for two conditions to be met: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
