# This program asks the user to input any positive integer and then performs a calculation known as Collatz Conjecture
# The calculation takes the current value and if it is even the value is divided by 2 and if it is odd multiplied by 3 and add 1 
# With Collatz Conjecture no matter what the starting value is the sequence will always reach 1 
# This program ends when the current value is 1

x = int(input("Please Enter a Positive Integer"))
