# This program outputs todays date in the format Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm

# Revisited to add the suffix after the date in the final output

import datetime as dt   # I have imported the datetime module and given it the shortened name dt
today= dt. datetime.today()  # today() is used to return the local date and time and it is set equal to the variable today
# I need to have a variable to assign a suffix to the date in order to have my output in the required format
daynumber= int(today.strftime("%d"))  # I introduce the variable daynumber here and set equal to the integer equivalent of the day of the month
# From my additional reading on strftime formatting I learnt %d returns an integer equivalent of the day of the month
# I had to add int to have the integer value %d be recognized and work properly in the below if, elif, else statements
# First I had just - daynumber= today.strftime(%d) and this didnt work correctly
if daynumber in (1, 21, 31): # I first had == and this didnt work so I have used in keyword instead
    daynumber = 'st'  # if statement used to assign the value 'st' to the 1st, 21st and 31st day of the month
elif daynumber in (2, 22):
    daynumber = 'nd' # elif used to assign the value 'nd' to the 2nd and 22nd day of the month
elif daynumber in (3, 23):
    daynumber = 'rd' # Another elif used to assign the value of 'rd' to the 3rd and 23rd day of the month
else:
    daynumber = 'th' # else statement used to assign the value 'th' to all other days of the month

print(f"The current date and time is: {today.strftime('%A, %B %d')}{daynumber} {today.strftime('%Y at %H:%M%p')}")
# I have used f strings to have all info I needed printed together in the same sentence
# I have asked for today to be printed using strftime to return the required results
# %A - Weekday full, %B - month name in full, %d - day of the week, %Y- year in full, %H - hour, %M - minute and %p - AM/PM
# I introduced a variable called daynumber which was used to assign a value for the suffix to the date and printed in output

# This program uses the datetime module and the strftime function within the datetime module to output the current date and time
# I constructed this program myself using the material we covered in the week 6 lecture as a starting point 
# strftime is used return a string representation of date and time which we studied in the week 6 lectures "modules"
# I completed additional reading on strftime: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html and https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
# I read about format tokens to format the date output in strftime here: https://stackabuse.com/how-to-format-dates-in-python/ and http://strftime.org/
# I used these format tokens to print the current date and time to the screen in the format requested in the problem
# I returned to the solution and added if, elif, else to assign value to the variable daynumber and also to add fstring for printing output
