This file will be used to run the program in solution 9 on the problem set
I have written the text in this file from solution_9.py file
I first asked for the file to open in 'w' mode to write the first line
Opening a file with 'w' overwrites the contents of the entire file
I then used 'a' to append the text here to the existing text
backslash n is used to go to a new line each time
In this program I will attempt to have every second line of the file printed to the screen
In the last line I am not putting a blackslash end
