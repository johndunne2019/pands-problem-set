# This program displays a plot of the functions x, x2 and 2x in the range [0, 4]
# John Dunne 2019-03-24
# I formulated this solution using the week 9 lectures as a starting point followed by further reading and research which is detailed further in the references section in the Readme file
# Additional reading included the matplotlib pyplot tutorial as recommended in lectures: https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html

c = 2**x # I introduced a variable called C and set it equal to 2 to the power of x. ** the power operator is used

pl.plot(a, c='r', lw= 4.0, ls= '--', label= 'x') # I have asked for 'a' to be plotted with a red line 
# c short for color, ls short for linestyle and lw short for linewidth
# I formatted the line that will be plotted using the attributes that I read about in the 'controlling line properties' section of the pyplot tutorial

pl.legend(loc= 'upper left') # This command shows the legend on the plot, I have given the names in pl.plot above using label
# I have used loc and upper left ask for the legend to be placed in the top left corner of the plot
pl.show() # This is the command used to show the plot created above
