# I am starting to develop this solution while watching the week 9 lecture videos
# Additional reading matplotlib pyplot tutorial: https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html 
# From the tutorial I see how to plot an axis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # mathplotlib.pyplot is imported and given a shorter name
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4])  # x axis is the default so x axis is set in the range 0 to 4 here
plt.show() # this is the command used to show the plot created above
# I hwill return to solution
